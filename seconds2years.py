#Exercise 1.3
#can a newborn baby in Norway expect to live for one billion (10^9) seconds?
#write a Python program for doing arithmetics to answer the question.

seconds = 1000000000
minutes = seconds/60
hours = minutes/60
days = hours/24
years = days/365
print years

print "the child will live to be %d" % years
