# Instructions

This assignement is due on Friday Feb 19 at 8:00AM. I will start grading on Friday morning. I suggest you plan to submit the work no later than Thursday evening.

## This Assignment

From the text, do the following exercises:

* 1.3 -- you submit a file named `seconds2years.py`
* 1.6 -- you submit a file named `interest_rate.py`
* 1.9 -- you submit a file named `sin2_plus_cos2.py`

You should create these files in the folder for this repo. (If you are using Atom to open this repo, the editor will automatically save new files in the right folder.) Then using GitHub Desktop commit your results (I recommend doing commits at least after completing each exercise). Then sync these to your github repo.

## General



* Edit the README.md file:
    * Change _\<your name\>_ and _\<date\>_ at the beginning of the file
    * Edit the line ```[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/ChapmanCPSC230Spring16/YYYYYYYY.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ChapmanCPSC230Spring16/YYYYYYYY)``` replacing ```YYYYYYYY``` with the name of this repository (should be something like ```HW1<your git name>```)
    * Reread the __Honor Pledge__ again and 'sign' it with your name at the end
    * Add your own text in the __Description__ and __What I Learned__ sections


* Connnect the repository to Travis CI
    * On the github site, go to ```settings``` then to ```Webhooks & services```
    * Then click on ```Add service``` and scroll to ```Travis CI```.
    * This takes you to a new page. Scroll to the bottom and click ```Add service```


* Correctly document each source file
    * At the top of each source file (```.py``` file), include a docstring in te following format

    ```
    """
    File: <filename>

    Copyright (c) 2016 <your name>

    License: MIT

    <brief description of the code>
    """    
    ```

* Ensure that what you push to the github repository builds correctly (the build badge displays as [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/ChapmanCPSC230Spring16/Assignment-X.svg)]()) in the README file.
